# Interactive Physiotherapist Agent
**Purpose of our project:** Our conversational agent is created to hold a conversation of at least 30 turns. The conversations is based on a user who needs exercises that aid in phsical therapy. The user lets the bot know of the specfic location of their injury as well as the type of pain they are experiencing. The bot then responds accordingly asking for more information to best determine what exercise would be best suitable.
